## What is Kids Charades?

Kids Charades! is a picture-based charades game that lets young children play without needing to read. Instead of words, the app shows vibrant, easy-to-understand images that kids can act out while parents and siblings try to guess.

## Why Picture-Based?

Traditional charades relies on reading, which leaves out younger children. By using pictures instead of words, Kids Charades! opens up the game to pre-K children and early readers. They can jump right in and start playing without frustration.

## Key Features

**No Reading Required** - Vibrant images replace text, making the game accessible for children 4 and up.

**Themed Card Decks** - Variety of themes including animals, magical creatures, and sports to keep gameplay fresh.

**Kid-Friendly Interface** - Designed for intuitive navigation so children can play independently or with minimal help.

**Educational Value** - Encourages communication skills, creative expression, and physical activity.

## Technical Details

- Available for iPhone, iPad, and Mac
- Free download with optional themed decks ($0.99)
- Requires iOS 16.4 or later
- Designed for ages 4+

## Why I Built It

Playing games together as a family is important, but many classic games exclude younger children because they can't read yet. Kids Charades! levels the playing field, letting everyone participate regardless of reading level. It's been rewarding to see families playing together and kids getting excited about acting out different characters and animals.

## Try It Out

Kids Charades! is free to download with optional themed packs. Perfect for family game nights, road trips, or rainy days.
