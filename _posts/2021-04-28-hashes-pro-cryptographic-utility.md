## What is Hashes.pro?

Hashes.pro is a straightforward web tool for generating, verifying, and analyzing cryptographic hashes. Whether you're a developer needing to verify file integrity, a security professional working with hash values, or just someone curious about cryptographic functions, this tool has you covered.

## Features

The service supports a comprehensive range of hash algorithms:

- **MD5** - Legacy hash function, still widely used for non-security purposes
- **SHA-1** - Commonly used for git commits and legacy systems
- **SHA-256** - Modern standard for cryptographic applications
- **SHA-512** - High-security variant of SHA-2
- And more algorithms for various use cases

## Why I Built It

Working with hash functions often means juggling command-line tools or downloading utilities. I wanted something that's immediately accessible, works in any browser, and doesn't require installation or setup. Hashes.pro runs entirely in your browser, keeping your data private while providing a clean interface for hash operations.

## Try It Out

Hashes.pro is completely free to use and requires no registration. Just head over to the site and start hashing.
