Welcome to your new Jekyll site! This is your first post. Edit or delete it, then start writing!

## Getting Started

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file.

## Adding New Posts

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.md` and includes the necessary front matter.

## Front Matter

Every post must begin with front matter, which is typically:

```yaml

layout: post

categories: category1 category2

```

Happy blogging!
